      <p>To help cover costs, some schools charge a fee for school experience placements. You’ll need to pay any fees direct to the individual schools.</p>
<p>
  You’ll need to provide:
</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
         <li>personal details - including your address</li>
         <li>contact details - including your email and telephone number</li>
      </ul>


      <p>
          Some schools also require you to undergo a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check.
      </p>
      <P>
        This is a safeguarding check to confirm that you’re suitable and able to work with vulnerable groups such as children.
      </P>
      <p>
        You’ll get a confirmation email after you’ve booked your school experience placement.
