      </p>

      <p>You’ll be asked to sign in using DfE Sign-in.</p>


      
            <p>The service is currently only open to specific schools. To sign up for the service email us with your URN at <a href="mailto:organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk.">organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>

      <p>
        You’ll need to set up a school experience profile so you can start receiving requests from candidates.
      </p>

      <p>
        To set up your profile, you’ll need to provide various details including:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your DBS-check and other candidate-related requirements</li>
        <li>whether you charge candidates any fees for school experience</li>
        <li>an outline of the kind of school experience you offer candidates</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Request details</h2>

      <p>Each individual request from a candidate will include their:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>full name and contact details - including address, email and UK telephone number</li>
        <li>candidate requirements - including their expectations and preferred experience dates and subjects</li>
        <li>degree status and subject - including whether they have or are studying towards a degree and the subject</li>
        <li>teaching experience - including how far they've got towards becoming a teacher</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">DBS details and fees</h2>
      <p>
        You'll also be told if candidates have got a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) certificate. These details will not be verified by DfE.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">
        It's your responsibility to decide if candidates comply with your individual DBS and safeguarding policies and book them on experience at your school.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can charge fees to cover administration, DBS check and any other school experience-related costs. You’ll need to sort out payment between yourselves and individual candidates.
