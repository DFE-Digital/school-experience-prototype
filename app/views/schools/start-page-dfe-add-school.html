      <p>Use this service if you're a primary or secondary school in England and want to offer school experience to potential teachers.</p>

      <p>You'll see details about candidates who've requested to visit your school so you can decide whether to offer them experience.</p>
      
      <p>The service is currently only open to specific schools. To sign up for the service email us with your URN at <a href="mailto:organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk.">organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
			
			<p>You’ll be asked to sign in using DfE Sign-in.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>

        
      
      <p>The service will ask you to outline the kind of experience you offer including details about DBS-checks and any fees you charge candidates.</p>

      <p>It's your responsibility to decide if candidates comply with your school DBS and safeguarding policies.</p>
