  <li>manage school experience requests - including accepting and rejecting requests with automatic email confirmations sent to candidates</li>
  <li>manage school experience bookings - including cancelling bookings with automatic email confirmations sent to candidates</li>
  <li>confirm candidate attendance - so you can help us reduce the number of no-shows</li>
</ul>
