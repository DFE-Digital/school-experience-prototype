      Accessibility statement for the school experience service
    </h1>

    <p>This website is run by the Department for Education (DfE). <p>
    <p>We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
      <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
      <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
      <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
      <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
    </ul>
      
      <p>We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
      
      <p>For advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability visit <a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/"></a>AbilityNet</p>.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Technical information about this website's accessibility</h2>

    <p>DfE is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

    <p>This website is fully compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard.</p>

    <p>This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>

    <p>This website is not compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard. The non-accessible sections are listed below.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>

    <p>The following content is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
    
    <p>Some images don’t have a text alternative, so the information in them isn’t available to people using a screen reader. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).</p>

    <p>We plan to add text alternatives for all images by September 2020. When we publish new content we’ll make sure our use of images meets accessibility standards.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Disproportionate burden</h3>
    
    <p>TBC</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Navigation and accessing information</h3>
    
    <p>There's no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a 'skip to main content' option). This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.1 (bypass blocks).</p>

    <p>It's not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to vertical without making it more difficult to view the content. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.4 (orientation).</p>

    <p>It's not possible for users to change text size without some of the content overlapping. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.4 (resize text).</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Interactive tools and transactions</h3>
    
    <p>Some of our interactive forms are difficult to navigate using a keyboard. For example, because some form controls are missing a 'label' tag.</p>

    <p>Our forms are built and hosted through third party software and 'skinned'’' to look like our website. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (information and relationships).</p>

    <p>We've assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information and with interactive tools and transactions. </p>

    <p>We believe that doing so now would be a <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/7/made">disproportionate burden</a> within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. </p>

    <p>We'll make another assessment when the supplier contract is up for renewal, likely to be in [rough timing].</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Content that's not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h2>

    <p>TBC</p>
