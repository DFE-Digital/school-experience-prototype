      Accessibility statement for the school experience service
    </h1>

    <p>This service is run by the Department for Education (DfE). <p>
    <p>We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
      <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
      <li>navigate most of the service using just a keyboard and speech recognition software</li>
      <li>listen to most of the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
    </ul>
      
      <p>We've also made the service text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
