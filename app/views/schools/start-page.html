        Manage school experience

      </h1>

      <p>
        Use this service if you're a primary or secondary school in England and want to offer and organise school experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        To help you decide whether to offer these 'candidates' school experience you'll be emailed requests including their:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>full name and contact details - including address, email and UK telephone number</li>
        <li>individual requirements - including their school experience expectations and preferred dates and subjects</li>
        <li>degree status - including whether they have or are studying towards a degree and the subject</li>
        <li>teaching experience - including how far they've got towards becoming a teacher</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You'll also be told if candidates have got a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) certificate. These details will not be verified by DfE.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">
         It's your responsibility to decide if candidates comply with your individual DBS and safeguarding policies and book them on experience at your school.
      </p>

      <p >
        You can charge fees to cover administration, DBS check and any other school experience-related costs. You’ll need to sort out payment between yourselves and individual candidates.
      </p>


      <p class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">This service is only for managing school experience in England.
