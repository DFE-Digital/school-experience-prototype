        Get a school experience placement

      </h1>

      <p>Use this service to find and request a school experience placement with a primary or secondary school in England.
</p>
      <p>Individual schools will decide whether to offer you a placement.</p>
    <p>
      Some will require you to undergo a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a safeguarding check to confirm you’re suitable and able to work with vulnerable groups such as children.
    </p>

    <p>
      To help cover costs, some schools also charge a fee for placements. You’ll need to pay any fees direct to the individual schools.
    </p>


      <p class="govuk-inset-text">This service is only available for school experience placements in England.
