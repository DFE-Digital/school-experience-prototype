				<p>After you’ve requested a school experience placement, schools will contact you to discuss your placement request.</p>
				<p>Be aware, during term time it could typically take up to 2 weeks for them to get in touch.</p>

				<p>The school will email or call you to discuss your request and placement date and also use this contact to: </p>

				<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
					<li>discuss your suitability for a placement at their site</li>
					<li>offer and arrange the best placement date they have available </li>
					<li>find out more about your placement requirements - including any disability or access needs </li>
					<li>let you know about any background and security checks you might need to go through</li>
					<li>let you know about any fees you might have to pay as part of your placement - including any related placement, parking or other fees</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					To help cover costs, some schools charge a fee for placements. You’ll need to pay any fees direct to the individual schools.
				</p>
				<p>
					You’ll receive emails after you’ve requested a placement and to confirm when a school has booked you on a placement.
