        <p>
          In Sprint 3 we started to look at how the Schools admin interface may function. This would help us test out hypothesis number 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          We started building a menu system in the prototype kit that lent itself to a gov.uk style interface. Placing menu items in the black header we thought would be lost. So we created a different style menu bringing the top-level menu items outside off the black header. This could then be tested with users to which they find easiest to navigate.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of testing the hypothesis number 2 we developed a skeleton navigation style for the second level and linked all this together so we could see if the sections made sense to users and ask them what would be expected in the sections and if this was what they needed.

          Testing out 2 styles of booking
        </p>
        <p>
          In Sprint 4 we wanted to test out how users felt about booking and was unsure whether the onus should be on them to confirm the booking or just give them confirmed bookings. So we developed the ‘your bookings’ sections to include a set of results and from these results candidate details pages were placed with differing options. This was done in anticipation of learning which most suited them. We also added a dashboard under ‘your bookings’ to help summarise information they may need. This would help us organise the right information in the right place and get rid of irrelevant information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also in sprint 4 we started to look at how schools may manage their candidates through the ‘your placements’ section. Within this we started to develop a calendar where they can view what candidate are booked in for the week ahead. We broke this down by subject so they could easily see what was bookd in. We are unsure if they need a monthly view so we will draw one of these and show them to see if its needed. As this area will be crucial to them managing their placements we will try various options here on paper and in the prototype.

        In Sprint 5 we decided to test out hypothesis 3. To start this off we looked what the candidate’s think and feel is the right amount and right content for giving as part of registration. This was set out with the basic ‘needed’ information then asking them how they feel about the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key part of hypothesis 3 was users searching and finding the appropriate school experience. We tested 2 variations along this theme with the aim of gaining direction on what works best.
