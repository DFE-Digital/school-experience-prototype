<!-- test -->
        <p>
          The School Experience Service will help more potential teachers easily find an appropriate school experience near them so that they can make an informed choice about a career in teaching.
          It will also help schools and other providers recruit more of the trainee teachers they need (and manage the demand for school experience from candidates)
          In addition the government can access timely data that will inform teacher recruitment policy and continuously improve the service.
        </p>
        <p>This will contribute to the overall vision that teachers can access a seamless set of services to begin their career.
